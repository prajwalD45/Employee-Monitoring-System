This project implements an **Employee Monitoring System** using YOLOv8 object detection to track employee behaviors (e.g., working, discussing) in real-time via images, videos, and webcam feeds. Built with Flask, it offers a web interface for model training and predictions.

## Features
- Real-time detection of employee activities using YOLOv8.
- Supports image uploads, video processing, and live webcam streams.
- Custom model training for workplace-specific scenarios.
- Intuitive Flask-based web interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application.
- **YOLOv8**: Object detection model by Ultralytics.
- **OpenCV**: Image and video processing.
